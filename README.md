## Description :
This is a project in fullstack. We developed an ionic4 food application using REST api callbacks with Angular and Mongo database. 
basic functionality of our IONIC application: 
- A totally secure login and registration system where the data is anonymized and encrypted.
- An administrator page that allows you to easily add recipes from our Mongo database.
- Users can see recipes proposed by the administrator but also unlock new recipes with a level system
- Users can post an opinion on the proposed recipes
